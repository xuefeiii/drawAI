![Preview](/drawWithAI/assets/drawWithAI.png)

## Instructions
To play with Draw AI, open the index.html file directly after download. 
After opening the file, wait for a few seconds for PoseNet and SketchRNN to load. 
Then start drawing anything with your head or mouse. 

**[Notice]** Sometimes the PoseNet model won't load correctly. If it doesn't work, try refreshing the page several times. 
If you know how it could work, please let me know LOLOL.
