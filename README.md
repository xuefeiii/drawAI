# drawAI

This project is an experiment on collaborative creativity with Machine Learning using [ml5.js](https://ml5js.org).


## Experiments

[**Draw with AI**](/drawWithAI)

AI and you will take turn to draw together (Bonus you could also draw with your nose)


[**Erase with AI**](/eraseWithAI)

AI will erase what you draw and you will erase what AI draw. 


## Background

Humans create. 

And we create tools to help us better create. 

In the cycle of bearing innovations (creation) and creating primitives for thoughts (tools to create), 
we arrived at our current point of time, 
where Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, as a result of creation, 
are becoming our new tools of creating more. 

With ML and AI becoming better players in certain fields like optimization, prediction, and perception,
questions around human uniqueness and existential value arise.
What machines struggle with while humans naturally possess would become the crucial qualities of future generations:
intrinsic expressiveness, cognitive flexibility, and most importantly, **collaborative creativity**. 

I define collaborative creativity as original ideas
built upon inspiration corpses, 
synthesized through human-machine collaboration, 
and curated through shared and alternating control.

In the future where AI could automate a large portion of repetitive, mechanical, and methodical jobs, 
collaborative creativity becomes one of the most crucial skills for human
to navigate the constantly changing sociotechnical landscape, 
and to grasp new opportunities of creation. 

To prepare people for the next phase of sociotechnical evolution, we start to question: 

**how might we cultivate collaborative creativity in our current generation and future generation?**

**How might we create tools for collaboration between humans, and between human-machines, that encourage mutual respect, control and inspiration?**


## This Project

This project aims to explore human-machine creativity in these two aspects: 
1. How might ML and AI provide new models of thinking and inspire new patterns of future creativity? 
2. How might ML and AI become tools of collaborative creation? 

For question #1, I plan to publish a series of medium articles to capture the findings of a semester-long examination

For question #2, I aim to create a series of small experiments of creativity platform for people to try out and play with, such the experiments I included in this repo with SketchRNN and ml5. 

I hope this project could serve as a thought practice in envisioning the future form of creativity, and a step towards building the future tools for creativity.
